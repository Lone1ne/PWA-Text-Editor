# PWA Text Editor

## Description

PWA Text Editor is a powerful text editing application that allows users to write and save text ON or OFFline. It uses IndexedDB to instantly store the users work, without clicking a save button, ensuring they never lose their work. The application comes with a service worker to pre-cache static assets to allow for offline usage. With one click, users can install the web application on their desktop, giving them the feel of a native app experience. The application is configured with webpack, allowing effective management of the service worker and generation of the manifest.json file.
